**How To Play: **
**  Checkers   **

*Overview*
Checkers is a game played on a 64 square board, 32 are dark, 32 are light. It is a two player game where each player starts with 12 pieces (checkers), which are placed on the dark squares in the first 12 rows closest to the player. The object of the game is to capture all of the opponent's checkers, or position the pieces so the opponent has no available moves.

A checkers piece can only move one space diagonally forward. It is only able to move backwards once it becomes a King. They achieve King status once the piece reaches the opposite side of the board. If a jump is available, the player must take the jump. A jump occurs when one of the opponent's checkers is diagonally forward or diagonal next to one of the checkers pieces, with an empty space past them. The opponent's checkers is captured and removed from the board. If after a single jump, another jump is available, the checker must take that jump too. This can continue until there are no more jumps available. Both regular and King pieces must follow this rule. If more than one checkers piece is able to move at the start of the turn, the player has the option to decide which of the pieces they wish to move.
